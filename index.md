### Grading

- **Attendance (10%)**

    Attendance in this class will be checked. Everyone starts with full credit (10 pts). For each missed session, an increasing number of points will be deducted. 0 pts are deducted for the first two missed classes. Afterwards, 2 pts are deducted for the third missed class, 4 pts for the fourth, 6 pts for the fifth, and so on. You can earn negative attendance points which will affect the rest of your grade.
    
- **Homework Assignments (30%)**

    Weekly homework assignments will generally consist of a problem set, to be submitted on paper. Students can work optionally work in groups of up to 3 on homework assignments. If you work in a group, your group only has to make one submission for the whole group.
    
- **Exams (60%)**

    There will be two midterm exams and a final. The first midterm is worth 15% of your grade, the second is worth 20%, and the final is worth 25%.

- **Grading Scale**

    |  A     |  A-   |  B+   |  B    |  B-   |  C+   |  C    |  C-   |  D    |  F   |

	Depending on the performance of the class, a curve may or may not be applied before assigning letter grades.

- **Grading Rubric**

    Most free-response questions will be graded out of 5 on the following scale:

	| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
	|       5 | You followed all instructions. Your work is accurate and demonstrates a mastery of the material.                                   | 
	|       4 | You failed to follow all instructions OR your work has minor inaccuracies but still demonstrates an understanding of the material. |
	|       3 | Your work has major inaccuracies OR your work demonstrates only a partial understanding of the material.                           |

## Additional Course Policies and Resources

### Communications Policy

My preferred form of communication is in-person after class or at office hours, or by email. If you email me and I do not respond within 24 hours, do not hesitate to re-send the email. Sometimes emails get lost in the shuffle.

### Late and Missing Assignment Policy

Requests for absences, extensions, or late submissions must be submitted by email with accompanying documentation. Only unanticipated family and medical emergencies, or other extraordinary events, will be considered valid reasons. Events that could have reasonably been anticipated, such as heavy academic workload, busy work schedule, or friends' birthday parties, will not be accepted as valid reasons.

### Academic Integrity

By taking this course, you certify that all work is your own. Plagiarism is not allowed, and you are not allowed to have someone else do any course work in your place unless explicitly allowed by the syllabus. If it is discovered that you have violated academic integrity on any assignment, you will receive a grade of zero for that assignment. Repeated violations of academic integrity may result in a failing grade for the entire course.

### Minimum Attempt Policy

You must at least attempt to answer every question on an assignment. If you skip a question without attempting an answer, you may receive a grade of zero for the entire assignment.

Why do I have a minimum attempt policy? Because demonstrating effort is important, especially in the workplace. Not even attempting a task is worse than attempting it and getting it wrong. I want to encourage all students to at least make an attempt at all tasks. As Kobe Bryant said, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."

### Special Needs

If you have a disability or need special accommodations, please register with the Disability Resources and Educational Services ([DRES](https://www.csun.edu/dres)) office or the National Center of Deafness ([NCOD](https://www.csun.edu/ncod)). If you would like to discuss your need for accommodations with me, please contact me to set up an appointment.

Special consideration may be given to students with caregiving responsibilities at home (children, disabled family members, etc.). Please get in touch with me if you need an extension and have caregiving responsibilities.

### Emergency Food and Shelter

If you are experiencing an emergency need for food or shelter, do not hesitate to utilize the resources available to you on campus. More information: https://www.csun.edu/heart.

### University Counseling Services

If you have need for counseling regarding any personal or academic issues, do not hesitate to reach out to the University's counseling services. More information: https://www.csun.edu/counseling/students.

### Tutoring Services

Tutoring services may be available for this course. Please contact the Economics Department for information: https://www.csun.edu/economics.

### Diversity Statement

It is my intent that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives will be well served by this course, that students' learning needs will be addressed both in and out of the classroom, and that the diversity students bring to the class will be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities in a way that is respectful to students from all backgrounds, and that students from all backgrounds have an equal opportunity to succeed in the course. If you have any concerns, feel free to reach out to me.

### All Other Policies

In general, the course follows all relevant CSUN policies and procedures as documented here: https://catalog.csun.edu/policies/alphabetical. Please pay special attention to the rules on **attendance** and **academic dishonesty**.
