## Income and substitution effects

Consumers don't make purchasing decisions in isolation. The price of gasoline doesn't just affect a consumer's demand for gasoline, it also affects their overall pocketbook and thus affects how much they spend on groceries, entertainment, clothing, and travel.

> When the price of good $$x$$ increases/decreases, there are two effects:
>
> 1. *The income effect*. Since the price of $$x$$ has increased/decreased, the consumer is overall poorer/richer. This causes him to buy less/more of *all* goods.
>
> 2. *The substitution effect*. Since the price of $$x$$ has increased/decreased, good $$x$$ becomes less/more attractive relative to other goods. This causes him to buy less/more of good $$x$$ and more/less of other goods.



## In-kind vs. monetary transfers

A food stamp is a voucher that the government gives to low-income households to help them buy food. Food stamps can only be used on food. Have you ever wondered if low-income households would be better off if the government just gave them money instead?

> A direct transfer of a commodity is called an **in-kind transfer**. A transfer of money is called a **monetary transfer**. Food stamps are a type of in-kind transfer since they can only be used to buy food.


We can use a graphical analysis of consumer theory to help answer this question.

> If consumers are rational, then in-kind transfers will always result in lower consumer utility than monetary transfers of the same value. 
>
> Therefore, in-kind transfers need to be justified by arguments outside the framework of rational utility maximization. Either consumers are not rational (i.e. they don't know what's best for themselves), or public policy has objectives beyond maximizing consumers' hedonic utility (for example, the government may want to promote healthy eating even if it's not the consumer's first preference.)
