## Review of Probability Theory

Probability theory is the study of uncertainty and chance. We often have to make decisions where the outcome depends on unpredictable factors outside our control. Probability theory is therefore an important tool for studying economics.

### Random variables

Probability theory deals with **random variables**. A random variable is simply a number that can take on many different values, with different chances of each value.

For example, if you roll a dice, the number that you get can be modeled as a random variable. If you flip a coin, whether you get a heads or tails can also be modeled as a random variable.

In finance, a common thing to model as a random variable is the price of a stock.

There are many things in life that are appropriately modeled as random variables.

### Outcomes and probabilities over outcomes

A random variable has a set of possible outcomes. Each of those outcomes has a **probability** of occurring. The probability of an outcome is simply the chance that the random variable turns out to that outcome.

> Mathematical Insight

> The probabilities over the outcomes of a random variable must add up to $$1$$. This is because if you add up the chances of each possible outcome occurring, they have to add up to $$100\%$$!

### Expected value

Let $$X$$ be a numeric random variable with possible outcomes $$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N$$. The probability of each of those outcomes is $$p_1, p_1, \ldots, p_N$$.

The **expected value** of $$X$$, which we write as $$E[X]$$, is defined as:

$$\begin{align}
E[X] &= p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 + \ldots + p_N x_N  \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^N p_i x_i
\end{align}$$

In words, you calculate the expected value of $$X$$ by adding up each possible value of $$X$$ multiplied by the probability that that value occurs.

How should we interpret expected value?  The expected value of a random variable $$X$$ is equal to the average value that you would calculate if you rolled an outcome for $$X$$ many times.

\end{align}$$

## Expected Utility Hypothesis

In economics, the expected utility hypothesis says that when faced with uncertainty, people seek to maximize the **expected value** of their utility.

For example, let $$X$$ be a random variable indicating a person's wealth under some uncertainty. $$X$$ has possible values $$x_1, \ldots, x_N$$ with probabilities $$p_1, \ldots, p_N$$. 

The person has a utility function over wealth given by $$u(X)$$. If the value of $$X$$ is $$x_i$$, then the utility is equal to $$u(x_i)$$.  $$u(X)$$ is thus also a random variable with possible values $$u(x_1), \ldots, u(x_N)$$ and probabilities $$p_1, \ldots, p_N$$.

The Expected Utility Hypothesis says that the person will seek to maximize:

$$\begin{align}
E[u(X)] &= p_1 u(x_1) + \ldots + p_N u(x_N) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^N p_i u(x_i)
\end{align}$$

> Jack has an initial wealth of $$\$1,000$$. There is a $$5\%$$ chance he gets into a car accident, which would force him to pay $$\$200$$ in repairs. Let $$X$$ be a random variable representing Jack's wealth at the end of the day. Jack's utility function over wealth is $$u(X) = \sqrt{X}$$.

> $$\begin{align}
E[u(X)] &= 0.95 \times \sqrt{1,000} + 0.05 \times \sqrt{800} \\
&= 31.4559
\end{align}$$

> Example
>
> Jill has entered a lottery where a dice is rolled and she wins $$\$100$$ times the number rolled. Let $$X$$ be a random variable representing Jill's lottery winnings. Jill's utility over lottery winnings is $$u(X) = \ln X$$. 
>
> Calculate Jill's expected utility from lottery winnings.
>
> $$\begin{align}
E[u(X)] &= \frac{1}{6} \ln 100 + \frac{1}{6} \ln 200 + \frac{1}{6} \ln 300 + \frac{1}{6} \ln 400 + \frac{1}{6} \ln 500 + \frac{1}{6} \ln 600 \\
&= \frac{1}{6} \left( \ln 100 + \ln 200 + \ln 300 + \ln 400 + \ln 500 + \ln 600 \right) \\
&= 5.7017
\end{align}$$

Note that the Expected Utility Hypothesis is just a *hypothesis*, not an absolute truth. There is some evidence from the behavioral economics literature that people don't always maxmize the *expected value* of utility *per se*.

However, most economists believe that the Expected Utility Hypothesis is a good-enough approximation of human behavior that has proven to be a useful tool for modeling behavior. It also forms the basis of most of financial theory. We will therefore continue to use the Expected Utility Hypothesis in this class.

## Risk Aversion

The Expected Utility Hypothesis can explain why people are *risk averse*.  Risk aversion means that people prefer certainty over uncertainty.  We can show that as long as a person's utility function over a random variable is *concave*, then the person is risk averse.

**Definition.** A person is *risk-averse* if they prefer getting the *expected value of a random variable with certainty* to facing the uncertainty of the random variable. That is, a person is *risk averse* if:

$$ u(E[X]) > E[u(X)] $$

> Jack has an initial wealth of $$\$1,000$$. There is a $$5\%$$ chance he gets into a car accident, which would force him to pay $$\$200$$ in repairs. Let $$X$$ be a random variable representing Jack's wealth at the end of the day. Jack's utility function over wealth is $$u(X) = \sqrt{X}$$.

> $$\begin{align}
E[X] &= 0.95 \times 1,000 + 0.05 \times 800 = 990 \\
u(E[X]) &= \sqrt{E[X]} = \sqrt{990} = 31.4643  \\
E[u(X)] &= 0.95 \sqrt{1,000} + 0.05 \sqrt{800} = 31.4559
\end{align}$$
>
> Therefore, $$u(E[X]) > E[u(X)]$$.


**Definition.** A function is concave if its second derivate is negative. That is, $$u^{\prime\prime}(x) < 0$$ for all $$x$$.

A concave function has a curvature which bends it towards zero, i.e. in an "inverse-U" shape:

![concave-utility](/CSUN-Econ-310/assets/images/21-risk-and-uncertainty-concave-utility.png)

**Theorem.** If a person's utility function $$u(X)$$ over a random variable $$X$$ is concave, then the person is risk averse.

*Proof.* We won't do a full proof, but we can make an argument by looking at the diagram below.

![risk-aversion-proof](/CSUN-Econ-310/assets/images/21-risk-and-uncertainty-risk-aversion-proof.png)

In this example, $$X$$ can take one of two values: $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$.  The point $$(E[X], E[u(X)])$$ will always lie on the red line, which is formed by the straight line between points $$(x_1, u(x_1))$$ and $$(x_2, u(x_2))$$.

Because of the concavity of the utility function, this straight line is always below the utility function. Thus, $$u(E[X])$$ will always be above $$E[u(X)]$$.

> People are risk averse if their utility function is *concave*. The greater the concavity of their utility function, the more risk averse they are.
>
> It makes sense for peoples' utility functions over wealth, income, and consumption to be concave. A concave utility function says that when your wealth is extremely low, even a little bit of additional wealth increases your utility by a lot. But if your wealth is already very high, a little bit of additional wealth will not increase your utility by much.


### Certainty equivalence and insurance markets

Suppose a person faces an uncertain amount of wealth, $$X$$. Their utility function over wealth is $$u(X)$$. The **certainty equivalent** of $$X$$, is defined as follows:

$$u(CE) = E[u(X)]$$

That is, the certainty equivalent of a random wealth $$X$$ is the amount of wealth that a person could have for *certain* that would give the same utility as the random wealth $$X$$.

Certainty equivalent is a useful concept for calculating how much a person is willing to pay to avoid risk.

>
> How much would it cost a risk neutral insurance company to insure Jack against his risk of a car accident?
>
> *Answer.*
>
> $$\begin{align}
u(CE) &= E[u(X)] \\
\ln{CE} &= 0.9 \ln{1,000} + 0.1 \ln{800} = 6.8854 \\
CE &= e^{6.8854} = 977.93
\end{align}$$
>
> Jack would accept $$977.93$$ wealth for certain versus having to face the uncertainty of $$X$$. 
>
> Since his initial wealth is $$1,000$$, this means that he's willing to pay $$22.07$$ to avoid the uncertainty of the car accident.
>
> Since Jack has a $$10\%$$ chance of incurring $$200$$ in damages, a risk neutral insurance company could insure him at an expected cost of $$0.1 \times 200 = 20$$. Thus, Jack is willing to pay more to avoid the risk than it would cost the insurance company to insure him.

> Risk averse people are willing to pay to reduce uncertainty. This opens up the market for *insurance*, where more risk averse individuals pay less risk averse organizations for insurance against uncertainty.
