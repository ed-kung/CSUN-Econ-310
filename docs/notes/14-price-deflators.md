In this section we'll derive own-price elasticities and cross-price elasticities using Cobb-Douglas utility functions.




## Income and substitution effects

Consumers don't make purchasing decisions in isolation. The price of gasoline doesn't just affect a consumer's demand for gasoline, it also affects their overall pocketbook and thus affects how much they spend on groceries, entertainment, clothing, and travel.

> When the price of good $$x$$ increases/decreases, there are two effects:
>
> 1. *The income effect*. Since the price of $$x$$ has increased/decreased, the consumer is overall poorer/richer. This causes him to buy less/more of *all* goods.
>
> 2. *The substitution effect*. Since the price of $$x$$ has increased/decreased, good $$x$$ becomes less/more attractive relative to other goods. This causes him to buy less/more of good $$x$$ and more/less of other goods.
