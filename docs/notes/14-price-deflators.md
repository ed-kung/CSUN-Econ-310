# Application: Issues with the CPI

## What is the CPI?

CPI stands for the **Consumer Price Index**.  The CPI is a measure of *aggregate* price levels. That is, when the prices of many goods are changing all at the same time, and in different ways, the CPI gives us a sense of how much these prices changed *on average*

CPI is measured between two periods: a base period and a comparison period. It is calculated by first selecting a fixed basket of goods, then calculating the total cost to buy that basket in the comparison period compared to the base period:

$$ \text{CPI} = \frac{\text{Cost of basket in comparison period}}{\text{Cost of basket in base period}} $$

> CPI Example

> There are two goods, $$x$$ and $$y$$.  In 2020 (the base period), the prices of the goods were $$p_x = 10$$ and $$p_y=5$$. In 2024 (the comparison period), the prices of the goods were $$p_x=12$$ and $$p_y=7$$. Calculate the CPI between 2020 and 2024 using a basket with $$x=5$$ and $$y=5$$.

\text{CPI} &= \frac{\text{Cost of basket in comparison period}}{\text{Cost of basket in base period}} \\
&= \frac{12 \cdot 5 + 7 \cdot 5}{10 \cdot 5 + 5 \cdot 5} \\
&= 1.267
\end{align}$$

> In other words, the cost of the basket increased by 26.7%.


A **price deflator** is a measure of *aggregate* price levels. That is, when the prices of many goods are changing all at the same time, and in different ways, a price deflator gives us a sense of how much these prices changed *on average*.  

A price deflator is always measured between a *base period* and a *comparison period*. And roughly speaking, it is always measured as the change in income required to maintain a constant quality of life (QoL) between the two periods.

$$ \text{Price Deflator} = \frac{\text{Income required in comparison period to maintain QoL}}{\text{Income in base period}} $$

In this lecture, we will consider two different ways to calculate price deflators. The two ways differ in their concept of maintaining constant QoL. In the first way, constant QoL is defined as maintaining the exact same consumption bundle. In the second way, constant QoL is defined as maintaining the same utility. We'll discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.



## Constant Bundle Deflator


## Constant Utility Deflator

> The constant-utility deflator and the constant-bundle deflator are different. This is because consumers don't have to maintain the exact same consumption bundle in order to maintain the same utility.  When prices change, consumers can substitute between goods in a way that maintains their utility even if some goods become more or less expensive.

> Suppose that in the base period, income is $$I=10$$ and $$p_x=1$$ and $$p_y=2$$. Then, in the comparison period, income stays the same but prices become $$p_x=2$$ and  $$p_y=1$$.

\text{Constant Bundle Deflator} &= \frac{p_x^\prime x + p_y^\prime y}{p_x x + p_y y} \\
&= \frac{2(10) + 1(0)}{1(10) + 2(0)} \\
&= 2
\end{align}$$
