# Application: Demand Shocks

In this lecture, we'll calculate a competitive market's short and long-run response to a negative demand shock.

## Setup

Oil is traded in a competitive market at price $$p$$. Consumers and producers are price takers.

**Consumers.** There are $$N=3,200$$ consumers. Consumers' utility over the numeraire good $$c$$ and oil consumption $$q$$ is:

$$ u(c,q) = c + \alpha q - 0.5q^2 $$

**Firms.** There are $$M$$ identical firms. Because of free entry and free exit, $$M$$ is can change over the long run. To produce $$q$$ units of oil, it costs a firm:

$$ c(q) = 0.5q^2 $$

1. In the year 2019, $$\alpha=10$$ and the market is in long run equilibrium. Calculate the price of oil and the number of firms.

2. In the year 2020, COVID lockdowns reduce the demand for oil.  $$\alpha$$ changes to $$9$$. Calculate the short-run change in oil price caused by this negative demand shock. Calculate what firm profits are in the new short-run equilibrium. (Note: In the short-run, the number of firms does not change.)

3. If $$\alpha$$ stays at $$9$$, how do you expect the market to evolve over the long-run?  Calculate the new long-run equilibrium price of oil when $$\alpha=9$$, and the number of firms in the new long-run equilibrium.
