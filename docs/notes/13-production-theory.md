# Theory of Production
{: .no_toc }

{:toc}

In this lecture, we'll survey some ideas from the theory of production. The purpose of this theory is to understand how firms make production decisions. This includes the decision of how many of each input factor to employ (i.e. labor and capital) and how much output to produce. The ideas from this lecture are often used in macroeconomic models that try to explain factor prices like wages and interest rates.

## General Setup

A firm has a production process that uses labor and capital. Labor refers to human effort, whereas capital refers to things like equipment, machines, land, and software. If the firm employs $$L$$ units of labor and $$K$$ units of capital, it produces $$Y$$ units of commodity output. The relationship between output $$Y$$ and inputs $$L$$ and $$K$$ is given the production function, $$f(L,K)$$:

$$ Y = f(L,K) $$

The firm is a price taker in both the commodity market and the factor markets. It can sell its output commodity at unit price $$p$$, it employs labor at unit wage rate $$w$$, and it employs capital at unit price $$r$$.

The firm's optimization problem is therefore:

$$ \max_{L,K} ~ pf(L,K) - wL - rK $$

That is, the firm chooses how much labor $$L$$ and capital $$K$$ to employ in order to maximize its profits.

## Returns to Scale

An important aspect of the production function is its **returns to scale**. "Returns to scale" asks the question: if all inputs are scaled up or down by an equal factor, how does that affect the commodity output?

- If scaling all inputs up or down by $$X\%$$ results in a $$X\%$$ change in output, then we say that the production function has **constant returns to scale**.
- If scaling all inputs up or down by $$X\%$$ results in a smaller than $$X\%$$ change in output, then we say that the production function has **decreasing returns to scale**.
- If scaling all inputs up or down by $$X\%$$ results in a larger than $$X\%$$ change in output, then we say that the production function has **increasing returns to scale**.

## Cobb Douglas Production Functions

A commonly used model of the production function is the **Cobb Douglas** production function. A Cobb Douglas production function has the following form:

$$ f(L,K) = AL^{a} K^{b} $$

The Cobb Douglas production function is governed by three parameters, $$A$$, $$a$$, and $$b$$: 

- $$A$$, called the **total factor productivity**, controls how productive the firm is *overall*.
- $$a$$ controls the relative importance of labor in the production process.
- $$b$$ controls the relative importance of capital in the production process.

An interesting feature of the Cobb Douglas production function is that you can tell whether it has constant, increasing, or decreasing returns to scale simply by looking at $$a$$ and $$b$$.

- If $$a + b = 1$$, then the Cobb Douglas production function has constant returns to scale.
- If $$a + b < 1$$, then the Cobb Douglas production function has decreasing returns to scale.
- If $$a + b > 1$$, then the Cobb Douglas production function has increasing returns to scale.

> Proof
>
> Suppose both $$K$$ and $$L$$ are scaled by a factor of $$\alpha>1$$.
>
> $$\begin{align}
f(\alpha L, \alpha K) &= A(\alpha L)^{a} (\alpha K)^{b} \\
&= A \alpha^a L^a \alpha^b K^b \\
&= \alpha^{a+b} A L^a K^b \\
&= \alpha^{a+b} f(L, K)
\end{align}$$
>
> - If $$a+b=1$$, then $$f(\alpha L, \alpha K) = \alpha f(L, K)$$. That is, the production is scaled by exactly $$\alpha$$, so the firm has constant returns to scale.
> - If $$a+b<1$$, then $$f(\alpha L, \alpha K) < \alpha f(L, K)$$, so production is scaled by less than $$\alpha$$, and the firm has decreasing returns to scale.
> - If $$a+b>1$$, then $$f(\alpha L, \alpha K) > \alpha f(L, K)$$, so production is scaled by more than $$\alpha$$, and the firm has increasing returns to scale.

> 1. Does the firm exhibit increasing, decreasing, or constant returns to scale?
> 2. Suppose the firm reduces both its labor and capital input by 50%. This would cause the firm's output to decrease by a factor of what?

>
> *Answer.* 
>
> 1. $$a=1/2$$ and $$b=1/4$$, so $$a+b = 3/4$$. The firm exhibits decreasing returns to scale.
>

> $$\begin{align}
f( 0.5 L, 0.5 K) &= (0.5 L)^{1/2} (0.5 K)^{1/4} \\
&= (0.5)^{1/2} L^{1/2} (0.5)^{1/4} K^{1/4} \\
&= (0.5)^{3/4} L^{1/2} K^{1/4} \\
&= (0.5)^{3/4} f(L, K) \\
&= 0.595 f(L, K)
\end{align}$$

&= 0.707 f(L, K)
\end{align}$$
>
>     A 50% reduction in labor without a change in capital reduces output by 29.3%.

## Cost Minimization

A useful, alternative formulation to the profit maximization problem is the **cost minimization problem**. The cost minimization problem is especially useful when analyzing firms that have constant returns to scale. The idea behind cost minimization is to ask: what is the minimum cost for me to produce 1 unit of output? 

The cost minimization problem is written as follows:

$$ \min_{L, K} ~ wL + rK ~ \text{ s.t. } ~ f(L,K) = 1 $$

That is, choose $$L$$ and $$K$$ to minimize cost, such that the total amount of output is 1 unit.

### First order conditions

This is a standard contrained multivariate optimization problem. The first order conditions are:

$$\begin{align}
w &= \lambda f_L(L, K) \\
r &= \lambda f_K(L, K) 
\end{align}$$

The two first order conditions and the constraint $$f(L,K)=1$$ gives us three equations in three unknowns: $$L$$, $$K$$, and $$\lambda$$. The system can thus be solved for the optimal combination of labor and capital to use to produce one unit of output, as well as the cost to produce one unit.

The two first order conditions also give us some economic insight: when firms are behaving optimally, the wage rate will be proportional to the marginal product of labor ($$f_L(L,K)$$), and the price of capital will be proportional to the marginal product of capital ($$f_K(L,K)$$).

### Graphical representation of cost minimization

Cost minimization can be represented graphically by an **isoquant** and **isocost curves**, as illustrated below.

![cost-minimization](/CSUN-Econ-310/assets/images/13-cost-minimization.png)

The curved black line is called an **isoquant**. It represents the combinations of $$L$$ and $$K$$ that can be combined to produce one unit of output. It is our *constraint* in the cost minimization problem.

The straight green lines are called **isocost curves**. Think of these as contour lines representing a hill, and the hill is the total cost for employing different combinations of labor and capital. The hill is rising in the northeast direction, but our goal is to *minimize* costs, not to maximize them.

The choice of $$L$$ and $$K$$ that minimizes costs is the lowest point on the hill that's touching the constraint. That occurs when the isocost curves are tangent to the isoquant: $$L=5$$ and $$K=5$$.

> The cost to produce one unit is minimized when $$L=3$$, $$K=7$$. The cost to produce one unit is $$5 \times 3 + 2 \times 7 = 29$$.
