# Application: Productivity Shocks

In this lecture, we'll explore what happens when there's a technological shock that boosts the firm's productivity.

Will this lead to more employment, or less?  What does it do to equilibrium wage rates and commodity prices?

Humans have wrestled with these questions for generations. It seems that every time a new technology is invented, people worry about what impact that will have on the labor market and the economy.

(Quote about working fewer hours). Nowadays, the question on everyone's mind is what **Generative Artificial Intelligence** will do to the labor market. 

Today's lecture will help us think about these issues rigorously.

## Analysis with a Mathematical Model

To model a technological productivity shock, we write the firm's production function as $$A f(L)$$. The productivity shock itself is modeled as an increase in $$A$$. (That is, for the same labor input, more commodity output can be produced.)

The equilibrium conditions are the same as from lecture 6, just with the inclusion of $$A$$ wherever $$f(L)$$ or $$f^\prime(L)$$ used to be:

$$\begin{align}
p &= v^\prime(q_d) ~ ~ ~ ~ & (\text{Eq.1}) \\
w &= d^\prime(L_s) ~ ~ ~ ~ & (\text{Eq.2}) \\
w &= p A f^\prime(L_d) ~ ~ ~ ~ & (\text{Eq.3}) \\
q_d &= q_s = q ~ ~ ~ ~ & (\text{Eq.4}) \\
L_d &= L_s = L ~ ~ ~ ~ & (\text{Eq.5}) \\
q &= Af(L) ~ ~ ~ ~ & (\text{Eq.6}) 
\end{align}$$

Solving this system of 6 equations in 6 unknowns would tell us the equilibrium outcome as a function of $$A$$.

> Under certain conditions, it's possible for a productivity shock to have *no* long run effects on equilibrium wage rate or employment levels. Instead, the impact is felt primarily in the commodity market, through lower prices and higher quantities. The main beneficiary of the technological shock is therefore the commodity consumers.
